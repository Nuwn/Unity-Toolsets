### Some ECS Systems i save for another time, not really polished stuff

Gamemanager is a statemachine that i made work in hybrid form and quite like.

EntityPooling is for when one uses hybrid setup, i used if to VFX, but VFX is a companion type, aka a Gameobject, thus not benefitting from the ecs stuff, so pooling would be good.

Timesystem is nice to have for when you want tick data.
